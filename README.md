# Lab 02: Selection Sort

## Overview
Implement selection sort and understand arrays vs linked lists.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement selection sort O(n²)
- Understand array vs linked list tradeoffs
- Analyze algorithm complexity

## Files to Complete
- `sort.py` - Implement `find_smallest()` and `selection_sort()` functions

## Instructions

### Part 1: Implement find_smallest
Find the index of the smallest element in a list starting from a given position.

### Part 2: Implement selection_sort
Use find_smallest to implement selection sort from Chapter 2.

### Part 3: Run Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

#### Arrays vs Linked Lists

| Operation | Array | Linked List | Why? |
|-----------|-------|-------------|------|
| Read      |       |             |      |
| Insert    |       |             |      |
| Delete    |       |             |      |

### Reflection Questions

1. Why is selection sort O(n²)?

2. When would you choose a linked list over an array?
